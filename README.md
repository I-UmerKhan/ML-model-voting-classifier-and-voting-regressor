# ML-model-voting-classifier-and-voting-regressor
I learned how to use voting ensemble classifiers and regressors, which are used to improve model performance by combining the predictions of multiple models. Voting classifiers and regressors aggregate the outputs of several different algorithms to produce a final prediction, leveraging the strengths of each individual model to enhance overall accuracy and robustness. This method is particularly useful when individual models have different strengths and weaknesses, as it can reduce the variance and bias of predictions, leading to more stable and reliable results.
